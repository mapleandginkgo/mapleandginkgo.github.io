## Hi there 👋🏼

I'm Sunny. I run a little ✨ jewelry ✨ business called 🛍️ [MapleAndGinkgo](https://mapleandginkgo.etsy.com) 🛍️

Sometimes I put out jewelry in my neighborhood or around my city "for free" or "for donations". These are usually items that don't sell well or have slight imperfections. If you'd like, you can 💸 Venmo 💸 me [@MapleAndGinkgo](https://venmo.com/u/MapleAndGinkgo), and at the end of the week, I donate the money to a special cause. It's a small way to brighten the neighborhood, while also doing some good. 💚

In 2023, I donated to [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/).

In 2024, I'll be raising money for the [Palestine Children's Relief Fund](https://www.pcrf.net/).

### Shop
You can check out my shop at [mapleandginkgo.etsy.com](https://mapleandginkgo.etsy.com). (If you plan to purchase anything, it helps me save 4% in fees if you use this link directly.)

### Social media
Technically, I do have an IG account for my small business, but I'm only active there, like, once a year. Still, you can follow along if you'd like [@maple.ginkgo](https://www.instagram.com/maple.ginkgo/) 🙂
